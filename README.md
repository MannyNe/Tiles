Graphical design using the GLUT library C++

This code uses the GLUT library for graphical manipulation. I set up the code to run without encountering problems (Tested on Visual Studio 2019), and it should work. But just in case it didn't, download and link the GLUT AND GLEW libraries manually on your system/IDE.

You could use this tutorial on how to link your IDE with the libraries: https://youtu.be/HKGJrzAuTvU
